AI Spawn Script Pack

Hey!

  I guess it's about time to finish this script pack. Would you like to help by sharing your ideas, 
or even implementing it in a way or another?

Should it all be module based or not?
If not, is this current way easy to use them? Or should we go towards Na_Palm's simpleCacheV2 with it?
Should we combine fillHouse & militarize?
Should we let some features slip away?
How to improve ambientCombat? Is my old additional wip ai communication script killing performance?
How about my door closing script?
Should all those main scripts be combined more?
Should my AIRS be joined to this? (unofficial version 2 is a lot better than the original!)
Would it be cool to rename this? (ASS? AI Spawning System?)
Should we have some more global and combined clean-up system?
Would you add some mission / task / objective presets into it? My early version used to have this "randomSectors" script,
  which combined these scripts into a simple marker based mission where objective was to hunt down enemies in markered
  locations. It also had different %-variables for reinforcements and so on.
How about dynamic stuff like random road blocks? I have old wip stuff for things like that too.
What about MP on dedicated servers? I have no experience on those things, so maybe you can help? I remember some people
  doing some simple changes into my scripts to make them fully work in MP.

  I know there's many bad habits I've used, e.g. I have classnames nearly in every script, parameters are being received
with 'old' method, some poor loops here and there - a lot little things to fix. It should all be tied up into a better
package with new features (more possibilities for customizations and so on).
  And surely one big MUST is fixed "simpleCache" script. Eventho current one might work with correct setup, it's slow and
has some delays.

So, what do you think? Would you like to join the last huge leap with this pack?
